# Sponsorship Prospectus

We're very proud to again be organizing the Ruby Retrocession conference. This event is specifically aimed to nurture the local community of developers, designers, programmers, and makers. By virtue of being an [Open Space Unconference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) it is self-organized and run by the community it aims to serve.

### Why Sponsor?

By the very nature of our conference, our attendees are some of the most passionate, connected, and involved in the Ruby community. For companies looking to hire this is an excellent opportunity to meet and interact professionally and socially with prospective candidates. By sponsoring you are showing your commitment to your community, open source, and the Ruby community.
